### Self-Updatable-E2-Kernel
 A self updating Expression 2 script for Garrys Mod.

 Currently, it's janky & incomplete. Starting with version 0.1.0-a0.1.0; this kernel will be tested, debugged & updated as time marches on.
 The idea with this script is, as the name suggests, it will self update a script that is linked to it.
 How this happens is by way of contacting my GitHub server for the latest version of the linked Expression 2 Script (henceforth abbreviated to "E2"),
 downloading the new code, updating the locally saved file(s) & resetting the E2. Thus, running the new code.
 The kernel uses Expresison 2's "autoupdate" feature to aid in automatically updating the E2 whenever it is spawned in-game.

 This project has come about because a lot of people are moving their E2 projects over to GitHub, & as they do that, a lot of their stuff spams the chat
 with update notifications ranging from "Current version is up to date" to "a new version is available" & everything in between.
 If you have a dupe that has a lot of E2s on it, such as a standard RLC 2.0 locomotive, you will know what I mean by this.
 Another reason for this project is, I find it tedious to manually update literally every E2 in my dupes, whenever a new update for one or more E2s are
 released.

 So, the idea is to simplify & streamline the update process, all the while having minimal impact on the running of the E2.

 With all of that being said & done (& given the nature of Expression 2), currently there is no way to automatically update the kernel itself.
 As new updates to the kernel are released, you will be required to manually update your E2s accordingly until further notice.
 This is not the case with an E2 that is linked to this kernel. The kernel will automatically update that E2 as new updates to that E2 are released.
